Data and code for "Defying the Degree Barrier: Arithmetic Shielding and Bimodal Effective Degree in the Titan Polynomial Family" — exhaustive prime counts for Q_q(n) = n^q - (n-1)^q across 18 prime exponents (q=3 to 167, n≤10^8, ~44M primes), verifying the Bateman–Horn heuristic and the Sophie Germain bifurcation.
